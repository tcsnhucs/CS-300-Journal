### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this course we were attempting to create a sorting algorithm for a list of courses, decide between 3 data structures which would be the most effective, and then allow an end user to view the sorted outputs through a terminal.
### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
The main thing I had to approach was deciding which data structure to use for this project. In testing, we tested the speed of all 3 algorithms in their write opperation, and while the one i chose, a tree root data structure, ended up being the slowest one, I still chose it because in my testing i found the speed to be relatively close for all of the data structures, meanwhile the tree data structure allowed for a much simpler and faster sorting algorithm compared to all of the other data strctures.
### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
My main way to overcome road blocks, of which I frankly didn't have many, was to research the text book of my course on what I should do to fix something and then just implement a solution based on that research.
### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The main thing I have taken from this project is the importance of choosing the right data structure for the job, that they are not all one size fits all and some data structures will be more efficient than others for certain use cases. 
### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
In this course we wrote pseudocode for every single part of the program first before we actually wrote the program, which i found helped me out with creating the program immensely as I wasn't as bogged down by making sure my syntax was correct while I was writing everything, and thus only had to worry about that during the implementation stage. I think it is something I will continue to do forever now because it felt much easier to code like that.
